### __Description__
The DealFinder program scrapes a webaddress for deals on dealsea.com. This program will ask users for the deals they want to search for and the frequency of search. Afterwards, it will display a list of the deals found with the title of the deal.

### __How to run it!__
In order to compile the program you will need to have java installed and ready on your computer. You will also need to add our jsoup-1.12.1.jar file to your build path. From there you can run the program in your IDE.

### __How to use it!__

The program will ask you for deals you want to search on. It only accepts space delimited text. For example, "chair table desk monitor". Afterwards, it will ask you for the frequency of your search. The frequency of search is the amount of time you want to wait between looking for new deals. For other reasons, this number will have to be greater than 30 mins.
